# ASCII Dungeon
The most playable thing I've made, this is a dungeon crawler played in the command line with random encounters, shops, keys to find and switches to be pressed. A simple party system is used, and players can pick their names and classes at the start of the game. A primitive save/load feature is also included, so players can pick up where they left off earlier. The code is a mess so I'm in the process of remaking this one from scratch (it still works though)
# Mario Generator
Will print a randomly generated Mario-type level to the console using a handful of premade parts. New parts can be added and existing parts can be modified to make more complex levels
# Minimal Pokemon
WIP: Recreating Pokemon Red in the command line. So far you can walk around Pallet Town and Viridian City with more planned. Actual battling/gameplay will be added after more of the world is built
# Psuedo-Raycaster Test
A cool little program that lets you walk around a maze in first person. The maze is saved as an array of 1's and 0's and the program is told what to display based on the numbers around your current place on the map
# RPG Test
An early build of Minimal Pokemon. Battle system is there (very simple) and you can walk around Viridian Forest
# Space Simulator Ver. 2
This is an updated version of an older game which I accidentally deleted (oops). I kept the world generation from the previous version but pretty much scrapped everything else. This version is slightly scaled back with simplified mechanics but bugs have been reduced considerably and it's much easier to navigate. Saving and loading games is also supported.
